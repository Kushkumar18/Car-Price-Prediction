# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts the selling prices of used cars by analyzing historical data and identifying the key factors influencing pricing trends.  
It uses a **Linear Regression** model, with proper data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure accurate predictions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for accurate car price prediction.
- Identify significant features impacting car prices.
- Provide insights through clear visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Quikr Car Dataset]
- **Features:**
  - `Name` â€“ Car name & model
  - `Year` â€“ Year of manufacture
  - `Company` â€“ Car brand
  - `Kms_driven` â€“ Total kilometers driven
  - `Fuel_type` â€“ Petrol/Diesel/CNG
  - `Price` â€“ Selling price (Target)

---

## ðŸ›  Methodology
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Downloaded from Kaggle in CSV format.
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Removed duplicates, irrelevant rows, and handled missing values.
3. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ One-Hot Encoding for categorical features; normalization of numerical data.
4. **Model Training** â€“ Implemented **Linear Regression** to capture linear feature-price relationships.
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Measured performance using **RÂ² score**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **RÂ² Score:** `0.89` (Strong predictive power)
- **Key Insight:** `Kms_driven` negatively impacts price â€” higher mileage reduces car value.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Box plots showing price distribution by company.
  - Scatter plots highlighting correlations between features and price.
